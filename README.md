# NFL Predictor 
<img src="Miscellaneous/NFL-PredictorFirstImage.png">

## Background
According to bettingpros.com, only 13 of the top 80 bettors had a win percentage of 70% or higher on
NFL Moneyline (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-odds_betting#Moneyline_odds">What is a Moneyline?</a>) for the 2020 season.

This project aims to see if we can use Machine Learning with readily available team stats to join the 70%+ club.
