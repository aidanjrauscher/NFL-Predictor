# NFL Predictor 

## Background
According to bettingpros.com, only 13 of the top 80 bettors had a win percentage of 70% or higher on
NFL Moneyline (<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-odds_betting#Moneyline_odds target=_blank>What is a moneyline?</a>) for the 2020 season.

This project aims to see if a Machine Learning model can join the 70%+ club using readily available team stats.
